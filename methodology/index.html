<div class="container px-5"><p>The software industry is evolving rapidly, and keeping up with the changes can be challenging. Drawing from our two decades of experience in the field and our thoughtful observations, we have identified several significant developments that are shaping the industry. We have tailored our methodology to address these challenges head-on.</p>
<h3 id="technology-is-a-manager">Technology is a Manager</h3>
<p>In today&rsquo;s technology-driven world, the concept of traditional management is becoming obsolete as technology can act as a manager. With automation and digitalization, tools such as continuous integration and project management tools take on management roles. This paradigm shift requires team members across various roles, including Business Analysts, Quality Analysts, and Project Managers, to have adequate technical expertise to effectively work with technology as their manager.</p>
<h3 id="lean-agile-mindset">Lean-Agile Mindset</h3>
<p>We strive to deliver maximum customer value in the shortest possible time while ensuring the highest possible quality. This is achieved through a lean-agile mindset that encompasses customer-centricity, design thinking, developing on cadence, releasing on demand, continuous exploration, integration, deployment, and innovation. Our agile product delivery moves away from a phase-gated approach to a DevOps approach, with a continuous delivery pipeline that streamlines the entire value delivery process.</p>
<p>We have built a continuous learning culture where exploration and innovation are part of our DNA.</p>
<h3 id="small-agile-teams">Small Agile Teams</h3>
<p>Gone are the days of big project teams with 100+ resources. We believe that smaller, cross-functional agile teams consisting of 6-11 members are the optimal size. Our teams define, build, test, and deliver incremental value in short time boxes.</p>
<p>Our methodology is tailored to address the challenges of the ever-evolving software industry. We focus on technical expertise, a lean-agile mindset, and small, agile teams to deliver high-quality products in the shortest possible time..</p>
