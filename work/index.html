Jawahar was keen to know more about ZDI as he was facing a unique challenge in managing the ever-growing size of the database which is used to manage the everyday business operation of his logistics and transport service providers. It is impossible for him to have any downtime of the database instance which is swelling in size and becoming a zombie. <br>OurKadai worked along with Jawahar in understanding the challenges and thoughtfully provided the solutions to address the database issues by seamlessly migrating to a partitioned database with zero downtime impact to the business. Thorough planning and flawless execution enabled this migration possible and reinforced the faith Ezee Infotech instilled in our skillsets.<br>It’s not a one-night stand affair.

But they are stuck with fear of unknowns that lead them into perplexing conundrums. They were undecided on how to foray into this online business model.<br>On a pleasant October forenoon, OurKadai team had an informal and cordial interaction with Nandakumar, Retail Director of SDG where these paradoxes around eCommerce are demystified. We explained SDG team about various facades of online business platforms by breaking them into easily conceivable vignettes. At the end of that discussion, we clarified numerous qualms that were blocking SDG’s online expedition. We could observe happy expressions in SDG’s team where we sensed the trust started budding amongst.<br>The team brainstormed diverse technical options and finally short-listed a couple of approaches that suit SDG’s business model where every aspect of the foreseeable future challenges was explained to SDG to enable them in deciding the right approach. Prototyping was completed and Proof of Concepts was presented that showed how exactly the solution would be in play post-implementation.<br>Right from front-ending website to the back office support, inventory control and Accounting aspects were also constituted in the solution that persisted as the most cost-effective approach in long run with bare minimal technical support that would be required for an ongoing business concern.<br>We enable our partners to prosper longer without our support.
