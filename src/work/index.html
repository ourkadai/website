          <p class="card-text mb-auto">Aurzart.com – ‘Made by musician for musician’ as the company slogan proudly
            pronounces. Not only the music instruments that is being sold, the whole
            ecommerce site is also solely made by a musician, managed and operated day-in
            and day-out by a technology novice.
            </br>
            Keen to know how this techno-romance unfolded? Here we go!
            </br>
            Hats off to Martyn Charles, who is proudly one of the earliest adaptors of no-code platform in India who
            launched his close to heart online music business in just a week’s time. Yes, you heard right! Vroom…From
            zero to hero, in just 7 days.
            </br>
            Technology empowered this change-over. With all modesty, OurKadai humbly proclaims that we enabled this
            melodious technology rendezvous, a reality. We made Martyn believe that online ecommerce business is just a
            child’s play even to a non-techie music enthusiast.
            </br>What is there in it for OurKadai to boast? Well, we baby stepped a techno-shy musician (until he met
            us) to the world of no-code platforms, without spilling any silvers. When your dreams take color, shape and
            fly without putting a hole in your wallets, what is that you call it as? Yes, Dreams do come true.
            </br>
            Now, Martyn is managing his ecommerce business all alone with incredible confidence without any kind of
            sustenance or support from any techies. We just relish the symphonic melodies from the side lines. What more
            a true Guru can expect than enjoying the success of his beloved and self-reliant disciple? That is what we
            call as, ‘Trusted Technology Partnership’
            </br>It really worth to pay a visit to Aurzart.com. Feel free to reach out to Martyn Charles to hear more
            about us if you desire.
