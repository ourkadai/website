        Made by musician for musician’ as the company slogan proudly pronounces,
        the whole ecommerce site is exclusively made, managed and operated
        day-in and day-out by a techno-novice music enthusiast, Martyn Charles,
        one of the early adopters of no-code platform.

        <br />
        This techno-romance is empowered by Technology and OurKadai enabled this
        melodious technology rendezvous, a reality. We baby stepped a non-techie
        musician to the world of no-code platforms, without spilling any
        silvers. Martyn is managing his ecommerce business all alone with
        incredible confidence without any kind of sustenance or support from any
        techies.

      <p class="mb-auto">
        Ezee Infotech is the custodian of the critical business data of
        privately-owned transport and logistics service providers in the South
        India ably steered by Jawahar Ramasamy. He was facing a unique challenge
        in managing the ever-growing size of the database which is swelling in
        size and becoming a zombie. It is impossible for him to have any
        downtime of the database instances due to the mission critical nature of
        the business data being handled.
        <br />

        OurKadai addressed the database issues by seamlessly migrating it to a
        partitioned database with zero downtime impact to the business putting
        Zero Downtime Indexing (ZDI) in practice which we presented as a concept
        in a technical conference where we met Jawahar.

        <br />
        Customer satisfaction is measured by the recurring business. We are
        proud to be on our client’s top-of-the-mind recall list whenever they
        face challenges. Latest challenge we are working along with Ezee
        Infotech is for creating Flutter based mobile applications.
        <br />

        Such mutual trusts that are garnered in our engagements make the
        technical partnership everlasting and endearing.

      <p class="mb-auto">
        Incepted in 1996, Sri Devi Group (SDG) is having 25 years of experience
        in sales and distribution of various international brands like Adidas,
        Reebok, Levi’s, Lee, and Wrangler. Pandemic and lockdowns dried down the
        footfalls in the shopping malls and exclusive retail outlets. SDG being
        a pioneer wants to foray into an online business model which is a
        logical expansion but they are stuck with fear of unknowns that lead
        them into perplexing conundrums.
        <br />

        OurKadai team enlightened Nandakumar, Retail Director of SDG about the
        paradoxes around ecommerce and demystify them by breaking into easily
        conceivable vignettes. Prototyping, Proof of Concepts encompassing
        ecommerce website, back office support, inventory and Accounting were
        presented that showed how exactly the solution would be in play
        post-implementation.

      <h3 class="mb-0">Dollar EH, Canada</h3>
      <p class="mb-auto">
        Dollar EH is a fast-growing dollar store brand in Canada, known for
        offering affordable everyday essentials—ranging from home goods to toys
        and stationery. While their physical presence was strong, they needed a
        digital transformation to match the modern shopper’s expectations and
        expand their reach across Canadian provinces.
        <br />

        OurKadai partnered with the Dollar EH team to craft a tailored
        e-commerce experience. We broke down the project into clearly defined
        deliverables: responsive design, intuitive navigation, Canadian tax and
        payment integrations, real-time inventory management, and secure
        checkout flow.
        <br />

        We believe in enabling our partners with the tools and clarity to
        succeed beyond launch. With a shared focus on long-term value and
        customer satisfaction, our collaboration delivered both reach and
        resilience in a competitive market.

      <p class="mb-auto">
        VET Institute of Arts and Science collaborated with OurKadai to uplift
        the programming proficiency of their second-year students through an
        intensive 100-hour Java workshop. The initiative focused on bridging the
        gap between textbook knowledge and real-world development skills.
        <br />

        The training emphasized hands-on learning with modules covering Java
        fundamentals, advanced concepts like Streams, Lambdas, JDBC, and
        software engineering practices such as TDD and version control. Students
        formed teams, built real-time mini-projects, and maintained GitHub
        repositories to showcase their work.
        <br />

        This academic-industry collaboration empowered 63 students with the
        confidence to build, collaborate, and contribute like real
        developers—helping them take the first big step from classroom learning
        to industry-readiness.
