It’s no secret that Software (Industry) is changing. But gauging what changes are where the muddle starts. With 2 decades of rich experience in the industry and thoughtful observations, we believe the below are the few noteworthy changes that shape the industry. We focus on gearing up against these challenging facets.

1. Technology is the Manager

Traditional 60%-40% mix of Technical & Non-Technical roles are no more relevant. 80%-20% mix is the order of the day. Team members donning various roles across the spectrum like BA/QA/PMO should have adequate technical expertise.
 
2. Lean-Agile Mind Set

The goal of Lean is to deliver the maximum customer value in the shortest sustainable lead-time while providing the highest possible quality to customers. Product Development moves from a phase-gated approach to DevOps approach with a Continuous Delivery Pipeline that extends flow to the entire value delivery process.
 
Customer centricity, Design Thinking, Develop on Cadence, Release on Demand, Continuous Exploration, Integration, Deployment, and Innovation drive the Agile Product Delivery. Continuous Learning Culture ensures exploration and Innovation are part of an Agile Organization’s DNA.
 
3. Bigger is boring. Smaller is smarter.

Gone are the good old days of big & fat project teams with 100+ resources. Enter Agile, the optimal team size now is around 6-11 resources. Agile teams constitute a good mix of cross-functional individuals who define, build, test, and deliver an incremental value in a short time box.
